# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The portfolio website currently has a basic dark mode implementation with a toggle in the navbar, but many components and sections are not properly styled for dark mode, resulting in poor visibility and user experience when dark mode is enabled. This feature will comprehensively fix all dark mode styling issues to ensure the website looks professional and is fully usable in both light and dark themes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio website, I want the dark mode toggle to properly apply dark styling to all components and sections, so that I can comfortably browse the site in my preferred theme without any visibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dark mode toggle is activated THEN all text content SHALL be clearly visible with appropriate contrast against dark backgrounds
2. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN all background colors SHALL transition to appropriate dark theme colors
3. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all cards, sections, and components SHALL have proper dark styling applied
4. WHEN switching between light and dark modes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and consistent across all elements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor using dark mode, I want all interactive elements like buttons, links, and form inputs to be properly styled, so that I can easily identify and interact with them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN all buttons SHALL have appropriate dark theme colors with proper hover states
2. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all form inputs SHALL be clearly visible with proper contrast and borders
3. WHEN hovering over interactive elements in dark mode THEN the hover effects SHALL be visible and appropriate for the dark theme
4. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN all links SHALL have proper color contrast and be easily distinguishable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor browsing the portfolio in dark mode, I want all sections including the tech stack, achievements, portfolio, and contact form to be properly styled, so that I can view all content without strain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN the tech stack section SHALL display technology cards with appropriate dark styling
2. WHEN viewing achievements in dark mode THEN all achievement cards SHALL have proper dark backgrounds and text contrast
3. WHEN browsing portfolio projects in dark mode THEN project cards SHALL be clearly visible with appropriate dark styling
4. WHEN using the contact form in dark mode THEN all form elements SHALL be properly styled and functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the dark mode preference to persist across page reloads and navigation, so that I don't have to repeatedly toggle dark mode during my browsing session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enable dark mode and refresh the page THEN dark mode SHALL remain active
2. WHEN I navigate between pages with dark mode enabled THEN the dark theme SHALL persist
3. WHEN I visit the site for the first time THEN the theme SHALL default to the user's system preference if available
4. WHEN the dark mode state changes THEN it SHALL be properly saved to local storage
